# Welcome to Loom
Loom is a small build system in Python.

Loom executes workflows in Asyncio, through lazy evaluation and memoization.
The `Lazy` class contains a `asyncio.lock` and a `Result` object. When multiple
tasks ask for the result of the same dependent task, the lock makes sure a
computation is perforemed only once. Once the lock is free, all future requests
immediately return the memoized result.

      .------.        .------. 
     |  Lazy  | -->  |  Task  |
      `------'        `------' 

      .--------.        .--------. 
     |  LazyDB  | -->  |  TaskDB  |
      `--------'        `--------'
